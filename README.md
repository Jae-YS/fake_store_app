# FakeStore E-Commerce App

A responsive, single-page e-commerce app built with **React**, **React Router**, and the **FakeStoreAPI**. Users can browse, add, edit, and delete products using dynamic API calls. This project is designed for learning front-end API integration, routing, and component architecture.

> Note: The FakeStoreAPI is a mock testing API. POST, PUT, and DELETE requests will appear successful but changes will not persist when re-fetching the data.
